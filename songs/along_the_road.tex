\intro{C}
\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{C}There, along the \chord[c]{F}road, was a tiny \chord[c]{C}home
  
  And the \chord[c]{Am}yard held dead ma\chord[c]{G}chines behind its \chord[c]{F}fences
  
  Like they were its \chord[c]{C}kids
  
  Broken \chord[c]{F}down, but still worth a lot to \chord[c]{G}someone
  
  It \chord{Am}made me stop and \chord[c]{F}grin
\end{strophe*}

\begin{strophe*}
  White \chord[c]{C}light from a dying \chord[c]{F}moon
  
  It blurs our \chord[c]{C}eyes
  
  And we \chord{Am}wear a cape of \chord[c]{G}fireflies
  
  And \chord[c]{F}after the world's in \chord[c]{C}bed
  
  All the \chord[c]{F}ghosts come sing along
  
  But we'll for\chord[c]{G}get them
  
  \chord[c]{Am}When the morning \chord[c]{F}comes
\end{strophe*}
\interlude{C F C\pause Am G F\pause C F G\pause Am F}
\begin{strophe*}
  And I \chord[c]{C}slept on the \chord[c]{F}ocean last \chord[c]{C}night
  
  I could \chord{Am}see you all, and you \chord[c]{G}all were dancing \chord[c]{F}side-
  
  -ways, your feet stuck to the \chord[c]{C}skies
  
  And I could \chord[c]{F}see the airplanes dance behind your \chord[c]{G}eyes
  
  And I was \chord{Am}glad I found the \chord[c]{F}time
\end{strophe*}
