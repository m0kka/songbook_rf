\intro{C\pause F\rep{4}}
\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   And you're the \chord[c]{C}one &
   Who scribbled a life-like \chord[c]{F}sun \tbnl

   And you're just what I'd be\chord[c]{C}come &
   And just couldn't wait till the \chord[c]{F}morning \\[0.5cm]

   And you'll \chord[c]{C}be  &
   The one who will fall on \chord[c]{F}me \tbnl

   And help me forget to \chord[c]{C}breathe &
   And leave me like that till the \chord[c]{F}morning \\[0.5cm]
   
   \chord[c]{Dm}And then you'll come &
   Like a \chord[c]{F}law-abiding accent \tbnl

   You'll \chord[c]{Dm}chop away &
   At everything I've \chord[c]{F}made
  \end{tabular}
\end{strophe*}
\begin{chorus}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   And it \chord[c]{C}feels like &
   Digging at the stone with our \chord[c]{Am}hands here \tbnl

   \chord[c]{G}And the \chord[c]{C}smart thing &
   Would be to drop it all and go \chord[c]{Am}home \tbnl

   \chord[c]{G}And the \chord[c]{C}right thing &
   Is never worth its salt in the \chord[c]{Am}first place \tbnl

   \chord[c]{G}And I'd \chord[c]{C}like it &
   If you find the time to leave me \chord[c]{Am}alone \\[0.5cm]
   
   'cause the \chord[c]{Em}difference in us &
   Is that \chord[c]{F}I won't flinch when you cut this off
  \end{tabular}
\end{chorus}
\interlude{C\pause F\rep{4}}
\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   And it's \chord[c]{C}true &
   There's scabs on my knuckles \chord[c]{F}too \tbnl

   There's nothing much I can \chord[c]{C}do &
   They'll scar like the ones be\chord[c]{F}fore them \\[0.5cm]

   \chord[c]{Dm}And now you've come &
   To \chord[c]{F}scatter all the ashes \tbnl

   And \chord[c]{Dm}spread them over &
   Everything I've \chord[c]{F}made
  \end{tabular}
