  \chord[c]{D}All the trees stood like skeletons,\pause\chord[c]{G}\pause\chord[c]{D} silhouettes of spilled ink\pause\chord[c]{G}\pause\chord[c]{D}

  And the snows fell in sheets and got wrapped around our \chord[c]{Bm}feet

  We built the fire evermore\chord[c]{A} with winter beating at the \chord[c]{G}door

  \chord[c]{D}Brother's eyes were getting heavier,\pause\chord[c]{G}\pause\chord[c]{D} his bony hands cold and white\pause\chord[c]{G}\pause\chord[c]{D}

  And I could hear his ragged breathing like the wind along a \chord[c]{Bm}knife

  There beside him through the \chord[c]{A}night, in the hum of candle\chord[c]{G}light

  I no longer felt the \chord[c]{D}time

  \chord[c]{D}Brother woke just after midnight, \chord[c]{A}and he didn't make a sound

  \chord[c]{D}And as he climbed from out of bed with severed rings around his \chord[c]{A}head

  His feet didn't touch the grou\chord[c]{G}nd

   Found a lonely tree \tbnl

   \chord[c]{A}And tied \chord[c]{Bm}himself within its limbs &
   \chord[c]{D}And he said to me these \chord[c]{G}words: \tbnl

  \chord[c]{D}And when I woke he was gone

  And \chord[c]{G}I was wrapped in blankets on the lawn
