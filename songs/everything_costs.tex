\intro{C\pause G\pause Am\pause G\rep{2}}

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   \chord[c]{C}Dreams, like coins down a well &
   Until I realized I was \chord[c]{G}dumb for be\chord{Am}lieving \tbnl

   To the bird with no flight &
   The skies don't ever \chord[c]{G}offer re\chord[c]{C}spite \tbnl

   So I wandered \chord[c]{C}off &
   And went to fill the \chord[c]{G}holes in my \chord[c]{Am}shadow \tbnl

   But everything costs &
   The proof was etched into the \chord[c]{G}backs of my \chord[c]{F}hands
  \end{tabular}
\end{strophe*}

\begin{chorus*}
  \chord[c]{C}I heard you say that you'd \chord[c]{Am}lost, you'd lost, you'd \chord[c]{G}lost, you'd lost your \chord[c]{F}way

  But \chord[c]{C}I don't think you had \chord[c]{G}much to lose, that house was never built for you
\end{chorus*}
\begin{chorus}
  And \chord[c]{F}I ain't gonna hang my head for \chord[c]{C}them, for them

  And \chord[c]{Am}I ain't gonna let them paint the \chord[c]{G}truth as sin

  And \chord[c]{F}I ain't gonna tell you it's o\chord[c]{C}kay when at the end of the \chord[c]{G}day

  You were just something to \chord[c]{C}blame
\end{chorus}
\interlude{C\pause G\pause Am\pause G\rep{2}}
\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   \chord[c]{C}Face, pressed into your hands &
   Couldn't tell if you were \chord[c]{G}crying or \chord[c]{Am}laughing \tbnl

   They both sound the same &
   When you ain't got no \chord[c]{G}skin in the \chord[c]{C}game \tbnl

   So I took up the fight &
   And the roaring in my \chord[c]{G}head was like \chord[c]{Am}thunder \tbnl

   Until I uncurled my fists &
   And allowed myself to \chord[c]{G}not give a \chord[c]{F}damn
  \end{tabular}
\end{strophe*}

\begin{chorus*}
  \chord[c]{C}I heard you say that we'd \chord[c]{Am}lost, we'd lost, we'd \chord[c]{G}lost, we'd lost our \chord[c]{F}way

  But \chord[c]{C}I don't think we had \chord[c]{G}much to lose, that path was never built for us
