\intro{G\pause G\sustwo\rep{2}}
\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{G}You took your hits, wore the \chord[c]{G\sustwo}bruises on the soles of your \chord[c]{D}feet\Pause\chord[c]{D\susfour}

  Well, who's to say if they're de\chord[c]{C}served? But you're turning reckless now

  \chord[c]{C\sustwo}I hear you saying through your \chord[c]{Em}teeth, that you'll take them \chord[c]{D}down \chord[c]{G}first
\end{strophe*}

\begin{strophe*}
  But I saw you flinch when the \chord[c]{G\sustwo}doctors got their claws on \chord[c]{D}you\Pause\chord[c]{D\susfour}

  I saw your smile start to \chord[c]{C}crack

  It's not so funny when you're \chord[c]{C\sustwo}sunk and there ain't nothing you can \chord[c]{Em}do

  When your \chord[c]{D}options are all dead \chord[c]{C}ends
\end{strophe*}
\begin{chorus}
  When there's no way \chord[c]{G}out

  I'll let you \chord[c]{D}build your home with me till the clocks run \chord[c]{C}down

  When your looks run \chord[c]{G}out

  Call me and \chord[c]{D}I will come and fix you, get your feet on the \chord[c]{C}ground

  When there's no way \chord[c]{G}out

  Call me and \chord[c]{Em}I will come and bury you, all safe and \chord[c]{D}sound
\end{chorus}

\begin{strophe*}
  And all \chord[c]{C}this time you've been \chord[c]{G}drifting out with the \chord[c]{D}tide, my friend

  But you can have what's \chord[c]{C}mine if it \chord[c]{G}helps you stay a\chord[c]{D}float

  If I close my \chord[c]{C}eyes I can't \chord[c]{G}watch you drown any\chord[c]{D}more, my friend

  But I'll tell you \chord[c]{C}lies if it \chord[c]{G}helps you sleep at \chord[c]{D}night

  And the more we \chord[c]{C}fight, the \chord[c]{G}more we don't get \chord[c]{D}right, my friend

  And the more we \chord[c]{C}fight, the \chord[c]{G}more we don't get \chord[c]{D}right
\end{strophe*}
\begin{strophe*}
  I \chord[c]{G}heard they \chord{G\sustwo}broke you\chord[c]{D}\Pause\chord[c]{D\susfour}

  That you \chord[c]{C}gave \chord{C\sustwo}in

  That you \chord[c]{Em}dropped

  And the fight had left you\chord[c]{\null}

  But \chord[c]{G}don't you \chord{G\sustwo}worry\chord[c]{D}\Pause\chord[c]{D\susfour}

  Makes no \chord[c]{C}differ\chord{C\sustwo}ence

  From the \chord[c]{Em}start

  Your \chord[c]{D}options were all dead \chord[c]{C}ends
