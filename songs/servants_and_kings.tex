\begin{strophe*}
  Through rolling \chord[c]{G}hills and \chord[c]{D}many miles of \chord[c]{Em}blood

  We \chord[c]{G}slept in the \chord[c]{C}rainfall and \chord[c]{D}marched through the \chord[c]{Em}mud

  And \chord[c]{G}you were \chord[c]{C}not like \chord[c]{D}anyone I'd \chord[c]{Em}known

  You \chord[c]{G}spoke with im\chord[c]{C}punity, had \chord[c]{D}nothing to \chord[c]{Em}atone
\end{strophe*}
\begin{chorus*}
  In \chord[c]{C}quiet \chord[c]{D}evenings you \chord[c]{G}told me what you \chord[c]{C}thought about

  \chord[c]{G}Servants and some \chord[c]{C}kings and how \chord[c]{D}everyone is \chord[c]{Em}bought

  And how \chord[c]{C}no one's \chord[c]{D}hands are \chord[c]{G}bloodier than \chord[c]{C}God's\chord[c]{G}

  And I \chord[c]{C}won't be judged for \chord[c]{D}doing as I \chord[c]{G}ought

\begin{strophe*}
  It's hard to \chord[c]{C}say just \chord[c]{D}when I fell in \chord[c]{Em}love

  There \chord[c]{G}was no e\chord[c]{C}piphany, no \chord[c]{D}light from a\chord[c]{Em}bove

  But \chord[c]{G}you'd be\chord[c]{C}come my \chord[c]{D}candle in the \chord[c]{Em}dark

  And \chord[c]{G}all through that \chord[c]{C}Hell you were the \chord[c]{D}shield across my \chord[c]{Em}heart
\end{strophe*}
\begin{chorus*}
  When \chord[c]{C}all was \chord[c]{D}fire, and the \chord[c]{G}weather's out for \chord[c]{C}blood
  
  And the \chord[c]{G}boys, still too \chord[c]{C}young to drink, were \chord[c]{D}drownin' in the \chord[c]{Em}flood

  \chord[c]{C}I'd hear you \chord[c]{D}laughing as I'd \chord[c]{G}come on out for \chord[c]{C}air\chord[c]{G}

  And I'd \chord[c]{C}laugh with you, pre\chord[c]{D}tending that we \chord[c]{G}care\Pause \chord[c]{[G}\Pause\null\chord[c]{C\susfour}\hskip 3em\null\chord[c]{C\rep{2}]}

  \chord[c]{G}Now twenty years have passed since the last time I \chord[c]{C\susfour}saw you\pause\chord[c]{C}

  \chord[c]{G}When I kissed you on the mouth you walked a\chord[c]{C\susfour}way\pause\chord[c]{C}
