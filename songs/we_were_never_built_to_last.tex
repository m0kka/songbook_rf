\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{G}You're on your own now. We're tired of lending \chord[c]{C}hands.

  Our new agenda: it cuts you from all our \chord[c]{G}plans.

  So get in line, boy. And keep that mouth of yours \chord[c]{C}closed.

  Don't need opinions. Just work them hands to \chord[c]{Em}bones.

\begin{strophe*}
  We stood in place and \chord[c]{C}watched them tear us a\chord[c]{G}part.

  They cut us open \chord[c]{D}and ripped out all our \chord[c]{Em}parts.

  But we kept quiet. \chord[c]{C}We let them have their \chord[c]{D}way.

  We made our point by having nothing to say.\chord[c]{\null}

\begin{chorus*}
  \chord[c]{G}We all broke up right on \chord[c]{C}cue.\pause So-so-so-so-so
  
  \chord[c]{G}We'll take you down with us, \chord[c]{C}too.\pause So-so-so-so-so

\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{Em}You'd better jump ship. \chord[c]{C}This bastard is sinking \chord[c]{G}fast.

  There's nothing to save \chord[c]{D}here. Our worth has all but \chord[c]{Em}passed.

  The muddy waters \chord[c]{C}are slipping in through the \chord[c]{D}cracks.

  The ship, the ship, the ship is sinking.\rep{2}

\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{Em}We sit on our \chord[c]{G}hands and watch it \chord[c]{D}all fall.

  No one blinks an \chord[c]{C}eye.

  \chord[c]{Em}There's not much worth \chord[c]{G}saving.

  Just lots of \chord[c]{D}buildings and concrete colored \chord[c]{C}skies.\chord[c]{G}

\begin{chorus*}
  But \chord[c]{G}then you \chord[c]{D}came and picked us \chord[c]{C}up.

  \chord[c]{G}You combed our \chord[c]{D}hair, and \chord[c]{C}made us look like \chord[c]{G}people.

  And we learned to \chord[c]{D}feed ourselves a\chord[c]{C}gain.

  \chord[c]{G}We built some \chord[c]{D}homes and \chord[c]{C}filled them full of \chord[c]{G}clones.

  \chord[c]{C}But we won't \chord[c]{D}wait until you get \chord[c]{Em}back. 
  
  \chord[c]{C}We'll be \chord[c]{D}gone long before you \chord[c]{G}arrive.\pause\chord[c]{F}\Pause\chord[c]{C}

  We were \chord[c]{D}never built to \chord[c]{Em}last. \chord[c]{C}But we'd \chord[c]{D}like to tell you:

  \chord[c]{G}Thanks \chord[c]{F}for the good \chord[c]{C}time. It was \chord[c]{D}nice to have known you.

  \chord[c]{G}We'll \chord[c]{F}all be just \chord[c]{C}fine, and we'll \chord[c]{D}try to write you.

  \chord[c]{G}We ap\chord[c]{F}preciate the \chord[c]{C}lies, but we're \chord[c]{D}done believing \chord[c]{G}you.\pause\chord[c]{F}\Pause\chord[c]{C}
