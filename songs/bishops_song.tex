   I've got a little \chord[c]{G}story &
   That I'd like to tell \tbnl
   
   About a boy named \chord[c]{D}Bishop &
   Who lived atop this \chord[c]{G}hill \tbnl
   
   People called him a slow boy &
   Said he weren't all there\chord[c]{\null} \tbnl
   
   But he never \chord[c]{D}harmed none &
   Oh no, he wouldn't \chord[c]{Em}dare

   But when the neighbour's \chord[c]{C}daughter &
   Said the child was \chord[c]{G}his \tbnl
   
   Well, the people \chord[c]{D}turned then &
   And wanted blood for his \chord[c]{Em}sins \tbnl
   
   Bishop tried to \chord[c]{C}tell them &
   That none had shared his \chord[c]{G}bed \tbnl
   
   But the words es\chord[c]{D}caped him &
   He found tears in\chord[c]{G}stead

  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   Well, his father \chord[c]{G}begged then &
   For him to bend his knee \tbnl
   
   That they might be \chord[c]{D}lenient &
   In time would set him \chord[c]{G}free \tbnl
   
   But the boy just stood there &
   With a steady gaze\chord[c]{\null} \tbnl
   
   And said they'd have to \chord[c]{D}break him &
   'cause bending weren't his \chord[c]{Em}way
  \end{tabular}

   So they came and \chord[c]{C}took him &
   And dragged him off in \chord[c]{G}chains \tbnl
   
   And with the town as \chord[c]{D}witness &
   He was forced to \chord[c]{Em}pay \tbnl
   
   It weren't 'til he \chord[c]{C}was gone &
   That the girl cleared his \chord[c]{G}name \tbnl
   
   And now his ghost still \chord[c]{D}haunts us &
   To this very \chord[c]{G}day
