\intro{D}
\begin{strophe*}
  I was \chord[c]{D}born when they took my name

  When the world turned wicked, when I joined their game \chord[c]{\null}

  But I turned and \chord[c]{G}fought them, like you always knew I'\chord[c]{D}d do

  I sat and dreamed at the foot of your bed \chord[c]{\null}

  You split my skull and reached inside my head \chord[c]{\null}

  And pulled out the \chord[c]{G}pictures I'd been wishing I'd \chord[c]{D}forget

  And you stitched me \chord[c]{G}up then

  And wiped the \chord[c]{A}blood from \chord[c]{G}off \chord[c]{D}my chin
\end{strophe*}

\begin{strophe*}
  Now I \chord[c]{D}sit on the rooftop's edge

  The muddy street beneath my swollen head \chord[c]{\null}

  And I'm trying to for\chord[c]{G}get you, to believe we've never \chord[c]{D}met

  And the sky is wrecked; full of rotting clouds \chord[c]{\null}

  From chimney mouths spewing smoke around \chord[c]{\null}

  And I can't stop \chord[c]{G}coughing

  My lungs just won't \chord[c]{D}calm down

  But still I keep \chord[c]{G}grinning

  As the \chord[c]{A}blood from \chord[c]{G}my face \chord[c]{D}stains the ground
\end{strophe*}

\begin{chorus*}
  A \chord[c]{D}bird, caught in the \chord[c]{Bm}wires
  
  Bleating for \chord[c]{G}help I can't pro\chord[c]{D}vide

  I'm not that \chord[c]{A}big

  I hope for the \chord[c]{Bm}best, but \chord[c]{A}nothing \chord[c]{G}changes

  I'm sorry\chord[c]{\null}

  But \chord[c]{D}I was blessed with bad \chord[c]{Bm}eyes

  There's a lot that I \chord[c]{G}miss, but I don't \chord[c]{D}mind

  I'm not that \chord[c]{A}old

  I'll find out what \chord[c]{Bm}broke me \chord[c]{A}soon e\chord[c]{G}nough
\end{chorus*}
