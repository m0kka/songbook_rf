\DeclareSong{Guilt}{Radical Face}{Therapy EP}[3]

\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{Am}I thought I'd walked a thousand \chord[c]{C}miles
  
  But it was all inside my \chord[c]{F}head

  My feet were almost where I \chord[c]{G}started off

  And I couldn't tell you why I'd \chord[c]{Am}bled

  And I'm not surprised by what \chord[c]{C}was said

  But it still hit me all \chord[c]{F}the same

  \chord[c]{\null}Just 'cause you see the storm

  It \chord[c]{G}doesn't mean you're ready for the \chord[c]{Am}rain
\end{strophe*}

\begin{chorus*}
  \chord[c]{Am}And I was dancing \chord[c]{Em}with my ghosts

  'Cause \chord[c]{Am}I could never let them \chord[c]{Em}go

  Oh, no, well I've \chord[c]{F}got to

  They're no longer \chord[c]{C}here

  And no one is \chord[c]{F}watching

  Sometimes your \chord[c]{Em}guilt just wears a \chord[c]{Am}face

  And I would whistle \chord[c]{C}in the dark

  'Cause \chord[c]{Am}I felt safe while all a\chord[c]{Em}lone

  Well, it's time that I \chord[c]{F}let all the dead be the \chord[c]{C}dead

  There's no honour in \chord[c]{F}suffering

  No reward 'cause you've \chord[c]{G}bled

  The rest can sort itself \chord[c]{C}out

\begin{strophe*}
  \chord[c]{Am}It's hard to say when things have run \chord[c]{C}their course

  While in the fog and still a\chord[c]{F}fraid

  And once you see what lies be\chord[c]{G}hind a mask

  That mask will never look the \chord[c]{Am}same

  And once the pattern shows \chord[c]{C}itself

  You can't pretend that no-\chord[c]{F}thing's changed

  It's hard to fake it when you \chord[c]{G}see the steps

  Before they're even \chord[c]{Am}made
