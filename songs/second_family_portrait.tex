\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   My life started slow &
   In a town of idle \chord[c]{C}minds \tbnl

   Where daydreams filled the \chord[c]{G}space &
   Between our simple dramas\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl

   And my mom was strange &
   But she'd always liked it \chord[c]{C}so \tbnl

   And all my \chord[c]{G}clothes smelled like &
   The room I was born in\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl

   And my dad was calm &
   Never used two words when one would do\pause\chord[c]{C} \tbnl

   And my brother's hands were mischief bent &
   With no \chord[c]{G}will to stop 'em\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl

   And on the whole &
   We lived simply in day-to-\chord[c]{C}day \tbnl

   Our fears were trivial &
   They always died with \chord[c]{G}every sunset\pause\chord[c]{F}

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   When I was twelve &
   My affliction came to \chord[c]{C}light \tbnl

   And I was told that some \chord[c]{G}things I heard &
   Were only there in my head\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl

   But I couldn't tell &
   Which were real and which were \chord[c]{C}not \tbnl

   And the question loomed over \chord[c]{G}all I did &   
   Whether I could trust it\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl

   And I guess over time &
   It became too \chord[c]{C}much \tbnl

   And I was sent away &
   At my \chord[c]{G}mom's behest \tbnl

   'cause she'd grown to fear me\pause\chord[c]{F}

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   Now I live up north &
   In the house for the broken heads\pause\chord[c]{C} \tbnl
   
   And my father comes and \chord[c]{G}visits me &
   Whenever he can afford it\pause\chord[c]{F} \tbnl
   
   Sometimes at night &
   When the voices quiet \chord[c]{C}down \tbnl
   
   I find I hope that I am \chord[c]{G}missed &
   And that they haven't forgot me\pause\chord[c]{F}
