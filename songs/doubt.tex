\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \chord[c]{G}Staring... Into the \chord[c]{Em}sun&  
    Always looking for an \chord[c]{Bm}answer \tbnl

    When I know there isn't \chord[c]{D}one &
    I get-get-get what I \chord[c]{G}can \tbnl

    'cause now I \chord[c]{Em}know &
    That those heartfelt \chord[c]{Bm}words \tbnl

    Were all empty \chord[c]{D}vessels

\begin{chorus*}
  I don't know if this \chord[c]{C}all will \chord[c]{G}end
  
  I don't know who to \chord[c]{Em}call my \chord[c]{G}friends

  I don't know how to \chord[c]{C}choose my \chord[c]{G}sins

  I don't know how much \chord[c]{D}more I can \chord[c]{Em}bend

  I don't know if these \chord[c]{C}plans will \chord[c]{G}take

  I don't know if it's \chord[c]{Em}all just a \chord[c]{Bm}waste

  I don't know if our \chord[c]{C}hearts will \chord[c]{G}break

  I just know that \chord[c]{D}we're here

  And that's enough for to\chord[c]{C}day

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \chord[c]{G}Drifting... Through another \chord[c]{Em}day&
    (Through another day) \tbnl
    
    Can't connect to what's a\chord[c]{Bm}round me \tbnl

    Laugh or cry, it's all the \chord[c]{D}same &
    (Laugh or cry, it's all the same) \tbnl

    I gotta sleep when I \chord[c]{G}can \tbnl

    But I have \chord[c]{Em}learned &
    (But I have learned) \tbnl

    That nothing \chord[c]{Bm}lasts &
    Not even \chord[c]{D}problems
