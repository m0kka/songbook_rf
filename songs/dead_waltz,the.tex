\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   \chord[c]{G}I saw your daughter yesterday &
   As I was \chord[c]{A}idle on the \chord[c]{Bm}porch \tbnl

   She \chord[c]{D}slept-walked from \chord[c]{G}your house &
   Down the walkway \tbnl

   As though she'd \chord[c]{A}done it all be\chord[c]{Bm}fore &
   And the \chord[c]{D}moon was \chord[c]{G}out

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   And in her \chord[c]{G}gown beside the riverbed &
   She \chord[c]{A}got down on her \chord[c]{Bm}knees \tbnl

   And wrapped her long \chord[c]{F\muss{}m}hair up in \chord[c]{G}vines, &
   And leaves, and branches \tbnl

   And with the \chord[c]{A}wind beneath her \chord[c]{Bm}feet &
   Oh, she \chord[c]{D}waltzed with the dead

\begin{chorus*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   And everything was \chord[c]{D}bathed &
   In \chord[c]{C}light white as \chord[c]{Em}milk \tbnl

   As the impossible be\chord[c]{G}gan &
   She danced across the \chord[c]{D}water's \chord[c]{C}edge \tbnl

   But her \chord[c]{Em}feet, they didn't \chord[c]{G}sink &
   As though she \chord[c]{D}flew\Pause\chord[c]{C}\Pause\chord[c]{Em}\Pause\chord[c]{D}\Pause\chord[c]{G}

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   I \chord[c]{Bm}ran out in the water &
   With a \chord[c]{A}lantern in my hand \tbnl

   I was \chord[c]{G}waist deep and shivering &
   I took her wrist and walked her in \tbnl

   I was \chord[c]{Bm}loathe to interrupt her &
   But I \chord[c]{A}had to get her home \tbnl

   If \chord[c]{G}people were to see this &
   They'd gather up, raise hell and burn her a\chord[c]{D}live

\begin{strophe*}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
   Don't you \chord[c]{G}mind, don't you mind &
   She'll be fine \tbnl

   Tie a bell around her ankle &
   Before she lays down at night\chord[c]{\null} \tbnl

   And the sound of her footsteps &
   Will wake me in time\chord[c]{\null} \tbnl

   Don't you mind, don't you mind &
   I'll watch over her\chord[c]{\null} as though she were \chord[c]{D}mine
