   \chord[c]{C}Back when I used to wander, &
   I was always out looking for \chord[c]{G}sign\chord[c]{F}s \tbnl

   But they were never \chord[c]{C}there, &
   So I'd pull 'em from the \chord[c]{G}air \tbnl

   \chord[c]{C}We all believed in something, &
   But like you I can't say \chord[c]{G}wh\chord[c]{F}y \tbnl

   It's just a whisper in our \chord[c]{C}ear, &
   Or a bottle for our \chord[c]{G}fears\pause\chord{G\susfour}\PAUSE\chord[c]{G}

  Come \chord[c]{G}hold me 'neath the \chord[c]{Am}water's \chord[c]{Em}skin until I'm \chord[c]{F}new a\chord[c]{G}gain\pause\chord{G\susfour}\PAUSE\chord[c]{G}

   \chord[c]{C}And I said what I was thinking: &
   Now you can't see what's good 'til it's \chord[c]{G}gon\chord[c]{F}e \tbnl

   Then there's something to be \chord[c]{C}said &
   For a place to lay your \chord[c]{G}head \tbnl

   \chord[c]{C}You told me I was simple, &
   And you injured me with that peace of my \chord[c]{G}min\chord[c]{F}d \tbnl

   And I listened to the \chord[c]{C}creek &

  'cause \chord[c]{G}down beneath the \chord[c]{Am}water's \chord[c]{Em}skin where \chord[c]{F}we will \chord[c]{G}swim

   \chord[c]{C}These days I barely wander, &
