Radical Face - Reveries

Light spills in through the window
And I watch the dust as drifts through the sunbeams
All while you stand cold in the kitchen
And all you've been wanting collects in the space behind your eyes
But I still wonder where my teeth went
I used to fear nothing
But now I just contemplate ...
The light spills in through the window
And you watch the clouds in the distance
And know we're out of time

You don't owe me
You don't me a thing
I have always been lost; It's a comfortable place
I don't owe you
I don't owe you a thing
You were always just something that I could never save

Time stops and all my old nightmares are standing before me
I wonder how they ever did their jobs
And I lay on the carpet and sift through my reveries
Try on the ones that still bite
Sometimes I wonder where you are now
And if you ever found some happiness,
Or just another way to kill the time
But I knew when this started that
I was never permanent
I was just another stop along the line

You don't owe me
You don't me a thing
I have always been lost; It's a comfortable place
I don't owe you
I don't owe you a thing
You were always just something that I could never save
