Ben Cooper - Branches

A hundred bad dreams were soaked in the pillow
As your arms spread like branches
And gathered all the sheets
I sat in my chair and stared out the window
At all the destruction that lay at our feet

And I had to laugh
‘cause all that we thought we’d won
Was sitting in the trash by the curb
I knew this day would come

The leaves hit the ground
A thousand dead thumb prints
They’re raked into piles like scabs on the lawn
We all lose our minds while searching for answers
To problems and cancers that we ourselves designed

And I had to laugh
‘cause all that we thought we’d won
Was sitting in the trash by the curb
And I knew that this day had to come

And we’re ghosts now, we’re fading
I can see through your skin
We’ll be stuck here forever
Say your piece and let them in

Yeah, we’re ghosts now, we’re fading
I can see through your skin
We’ll be stuck here forever
Say your piece and let them in
