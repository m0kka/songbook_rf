A bruise
A bruise upon my chest
The place I lay my head
The food is always burned
The tea is boiling over
The painting on my wall
The mess upon my floor
And none of it was ever real

If every day
Goes my way
I'm sure I'll find a way to complain
Cause I've made an art
Of falling apart
And every day begins to look the same
A negative fame

A call
A call for someone dead
It made me feel alive
It made the day so bright 
I never thought I'd see it
A light tucked in a box
I'm finally going home
And all of it was smart to do (?, unsure)

On top of the world
I'll glitter the ground (?, unsure)
One of these days I probably won't be around
A long happy life
An old tired house
A place to call home whenever life goes south

A cynical outlook
An old dried up heart
A person who loves you
My favourite part
They're happy to see me
And I feel the same
And this is my home
And I forgot to complain
