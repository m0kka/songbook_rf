Sunn - Radical Face

I watched the sunlight cross the furniture
And I didn't flinch when it all got burned away
And while in the middle of those fires
I always found myself with nothing much to say
And I used to wish my blood would travel
That my genetic line, it wouldn't end with me
But in the light of all that's built me
I see that some dead ends
Were probably for the best

Oh come find these thoughts and pull them out of me
'cause they're nothing I have asked for
Sometimes when sleep becomes your enemy
It feels better to dream while the sun is accounted for

Sang the song that I swore I would
And until my voice was gone
Now I'm just listening
While the sunlight cuts it's name in my skin
And I left my ghost along the shore
To find a port to harbour me
Oh but I ain't so young
To believe a home is ever very permanent

So save yourself a little breath
We don't often change what we're scared of
And we just paint the scars and pretend they were never there
You can save yourself a second guess
When it's all a cycle

Oh come find these thoughts and pull them out of me
'cause they're nothing I have asked for
Sometimes when sleep becomes your enemy
It feels better to dream while the sun is accounted for

'cause I only want to let this go
