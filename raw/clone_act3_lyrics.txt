Radical Face & Rickulos - Clone | Act 3: The City, Daytime

[Intro]



[Part 1]

So this tunnel has end

So bright my eyes can't open

Vision fades to normal now

What's that overwhelming sound?

Who are all these people here?

Should I be afraid of them?

Some are trapped in strange machines

Some are going inside buildings?



		Towers surround me

		Where did all this come from?



No one seems to notice me

They're on their way to I don't know where

They all move so rapidly

No one looks the same at all

So many things are living here

I wonder where they all come from

This energy is filing me

Fall into a sea of people



		Movement surrounds me
		
		Follow the current now



[Interlude]



[Part 2]

Now I understand

Everybody must do something

Some will open doors and some shake hands

Some will sleep outside

Some will stare of into nothing

I will open doors

I will see what's inside trash cans

I will often ride the moving stairs

Now I understand

Everybody must do something



[Interlude]



[Part 3]

Did I have it wrong?

No everyone's gone

When the water fell from the sky

And I'm alone

The world is gray and skin is cold

ANd my clothes are all heavy now

Is it something that I have done?

Did I not understand?

Everyhing's wet and shining now

Is this what they don't want?

This is water is cleaning us

It's not so bad after all

It's not so bad after all



[Interlude]



[Part 4]

Hey there, kid, lovely weather tonight

Like the gods are all pissing from high

What you doin' out there? Tryin' to drown?

Follow me, step inside and settle down

	I don't know what to think of all this
	
It's just rain, it'll be gone in a bit

Come inside near the fire, take a seat

I know what just what you need

	Though I feel much better now
	
	But why? Why did you help me out?
	
Why do dogs bite? Why is blood red?

That's just what friends are for



[Interlude]



[Outro]

Quiet, please

Trust in me, boy

I know what

You're good for
